#### Processing Flow

1. **Data Input** – User enters health values through the interactive dashboard
2. **Rule-Based Analysis** – Application applies medical logic to:
   - Classify BMI categories
   - Interpret blood pressure levels
   - Analyze glucose readings
   - Detect anemia and infection risks
   - Evaluate lipid disorders
3. **Report Generation** – System produces:
   - Comprehensive health summary
   - Critical risk flags
   - Personalized diet recommendations
   - Customized exercise plans
4. **Export Options** – Users can:
   - Download PDF health report
   - Export CSV data file
